## Snapshots and not Changes 

Git doesn't store data as a series of changes , it stores data as series of snapshots.

When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This object also contains the authorâ€™s name and email address, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.

#### Example:
Let's illustrate this with code for better understanding , follow the below steps
-  Make a empty directory 
-  Initialize git repo
-  Make  changes

```bash
mkdir MeraRepo
cd MeraRepo
git init 
touch index.js index.html styles.css
## Add the changes to staging areas 
git add . 
git commit -m "Web Project kr rha initalize"
```

##### What happens behind the scenes ?

If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.
